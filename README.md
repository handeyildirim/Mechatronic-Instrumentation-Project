# Mechatronic-Instrumentation-Project
In this project, we will try to move our device using specific values which are defined by user and we have to get trapezoidal velocity profil during this motion. For this project we need some devices which are pc (for write our algorithmic code), Arduino (for use as a processor), bread board (for build our circuit), ETU kit (device that we are trying to move),stepper (source of movement),motor driver (create a connection between arduino and stepper), and limit switch (for bring our device to starting position). We can describe the how this system work with a few basic steps. First of all we are setting starting position of our device using limit switch signals. Then we are take some specific values from user and according to these values arduino sends signals to our stepper . According to these signals our stepper starts rotating different durations and speeds. When we reach to the desired position (our target) we are waiting a few seconds there. Then, stepper rotating opposite side and our device ( ETU kit) starts moving to starting position until the limit switch signal is turned off and asks new specific values. This loop continues until power is off.
